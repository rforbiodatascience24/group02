## Micro-report lab 07

### Loading the data 

The data is taken from “PCA tidyverse style” by Claus O. Wilke, Professor of Integrative Biology. It's a biopsy data set, based on breast cancer patients from the University of Wisconsin Hospital. The doctor in charge assessed biopsies from 699 patients.

```         
biopsy <- read_csv("https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv")
```

```         
```
