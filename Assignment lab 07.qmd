## Micro-report lab 07

### Loading the data

The data is taken from “PCA tidyverse style” by Claus O. Wilke, Professor of Integrative Biology. It's a biopsy data set, based on breast cancer patients from the University of Wisconsin Hospital. The doctor in charge assessed biopsies from 699 patients.

We're loading the data, and since it's a dataset on biopsies, that's what we will call it.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
biopsy <- read_csv('https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv')
biopsy
```
